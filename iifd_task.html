<p> Ms. Smith is a teacher and she just finished checking some coloring assignments from her students, and organized them into a nice, tidy pile to return to the students. </p>
<p> But when she went to the kitchen to make a snack, her cat Wiggles jumped on the pile and made a huge mess! </p>
<p> Ms. Smith needs help straightening up the assignments and sorting them to give back to her students! </p>
<p> Can you help her figure out which assignment she gave to each student? </p>

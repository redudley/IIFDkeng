<h2>Thanks for your participation!</h2>

<p> Mary just finished an assignment for class. She had to color in different shapes on some flashcards, based on instructions from her teacher. She's sure she did a great job. </p>
<p> But when she stepped out of the room to grab a snack, her cat Mr. Wiggles knocked over the pile of flashcards, and he even ripped some of them up! </p>
<p>  Now Mary can't figure out which card she filled out for which prompt! Can you help her sort them out so she can turn them in? </p>
